In my post on <a href="/threejs-geometry">Geometry in Three.js</a> I discussed the different types of primitives we have available. Primitives are a powerful tool but creating 3D objects with only primitives and code can only get you so far. For full control over your 3D models it is best to use a 3D modeling application and then import your models into Three.js.
</p>

<h2>Blender</h2>
<p>
There are many 3D modeling applications like Maya and Cinema 4D. But in this post we are going to focus on Blender because it is free and open-sourced. Also Three.js comes bundled with a plug-in that allows you to export content directly from Blender into a JSON format which can be loaded into Three.js. You can download Blender at <a href="https://www.blender.org/">blender.org</a>, the version we are going to use is 2.77a.
</p>

To install the plug-in...

<small>Note: these examples were created using Three.js v79. Three.js is known to update frequently and sometimes cause breaking changes to the API so it may be worth checking the version you are using.</small>
