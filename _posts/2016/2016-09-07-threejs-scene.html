<p>
Let's set up a basic scene in Three.js. The first thing you need to do is include the Three.js library. You can download it at <a href="www.threejs.org">threejs.org</a>. You can also use the CDN url from cdnjs <code>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r79/three.js</code>.

<br/>
<small>Note: these examples were created using Three.js v79. Three.js is known to update frequently and sometimes cause breaking changes to the API so it may be worth checking the version you are using.</small>
