  what skills they must have: <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/12/09/future-journalist/"
  target="_blank">8 Must-Have Traits of Tomorrow&rsquo;s Journalist</a>. &nbsp;This
  got me thinking about colleges and the kinds of Journalism classes they had. &nbsp;I
  was thinking how hard it must be for college professors who have to constantly be
  learning new skills for these evolving and adapting professions. &nbsp;Then I remembered
  the coursework comprised of mostly history and theory. &nbsp;History and Theory
  for the most part never change, they only expand with whatever new history or new
  theories come about. &nbsp;In this way the educators don&rsquo;t necessarily have
  to be frantic about new and expanding job markets, they only have to pop an extra
  question on the final exam. It should be noted that Theory and History alone do
  nothing to make you better at anything, they only help you understand concepts and
  how things became the way they are. &nbsp;It is only in the application of these
  concepts in a meaningful way that actually results in any useful knowledge. &nbsp;And
  this is what it seems education currently leaves out for the most part, the part
  it expects people to figure out on their own.</p>'
