<p>The Quest for the Graphical Web was an experimental presentation I put together with some amazing friends and the team at Adobe to tell the story of how the web is evolving from a graphical perspective. You can watch the&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;watch?v=P2Yj-8zGa3U">full recording of the presentation<&#47;a>&nbsp;from the Create the Web event. &nbsp;A web version can be viewed online at&nbsp;<a href="http:&#47;&#47;thegraphicalweb.com&#47;">thegraphicalweb.com<&#47;a>. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve also open-sourced the presentation on&nbsp;<a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;adobe&#47;graphicalweb-keynote">github<&#47;a>. &nbsp;We used a lot of different technologies to bring this website to life, including WebGL, 2D Canvas, SVG, and CSS 3D Transforms, as well as some features not yet implemented by mainstream browsers. &nbsp;It involves a colorful story full of bright characters telling a tale of where we see the web going. &nbsp;You can read the full blog post about how we made it <a href="http:&#47;&#47;blogs.adobe.com&#47;webplatform&#47;2012&#47;10&#47;17&#47;the-graphical-web-experiment&#47;">here<&#47;a>.</p>
