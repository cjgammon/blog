<p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to speak at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.w3.org&#47;conf&#47;2013sf&#47;">W3Conf<&#47;a> in San Francisco this year. My talk was about reading experiences on the web, ways we can improve them and where we see this going in the future. In the talk I show off how we can use Regions for visually stunning magazine layout and responsive pagination. There are also some examples of Exclusions being used in creative designs for web based children's books&#47;games or responsive comic books. You can view the video of my talk below and find the source for the presentation <a href="https:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;cjgammon&#47;electricbooks">on github<&#47;a>. Be sure to check out all the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.youtube.com&#47;user&#47;W3Conf?feature=watch">other amazing speakers<&#47;a> from the conference as well.</p>
