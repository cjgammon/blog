<p>So it seems with RSS feeds, twitter, and quick data formatting of information where it is today we could take this model and expand it to all forms of information.  For example, books, with this model we could turn all books into an RSS feed of chapter titles, you then click the chapter title to expand the first paragraph of the chapter or a synopsis.  You could then click the link to read the full chapter.  This seems like a more streamlined and intuitive version of cliffnotes for a culture seemingly obsessed with finding the information they want right away.  Although they could always just google it.</p>
