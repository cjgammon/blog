<p>So there's been this <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=as3+unload+sound&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">long existing problem</a> within flash and externally loaded .swf's where it will continue to play sounds and fire event listeners long after it has been removed from the stage.&nbsp; With Flash Player 10 they've finally brought about a solution with the unloadAndStop() function wich can be called by the Loader class.&nbsp; This in combination with the SoundMixer.stopAll(), should get your external content cleanly out of the way for more content to load.</p>
