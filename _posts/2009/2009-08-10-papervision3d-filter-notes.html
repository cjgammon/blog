<p>Typically when adding filters in papervision you have to use ViewportLayers and apply the filters to them, however this can become messy and tedious if you are applying filters to a large number of objects.  So instead you can simply set the objects attribute useOwnContainer to true, and then apply filters directly to the object.</p>
<p><code>useOwnContainer = true;</code></p>
<p>When zooming in a great deal on an object which uses a filter or with many objects in a scene which have filters applied to them, if you do not turn the filters off during this zoom, the flash movie can have a tendency to freeze or lag the frame rate to just about zero.</p>
