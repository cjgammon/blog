<p>I spoke at HTML5DevConf last October. My talk was called "Web + Wow" and explored the web as rich medium and different techniques people can use for some interesting effects. You can find the synopsis and video below and the slides are up <a href="http:&#47;&#47;slides.cjgammon.com&#47;13-10-web-wow&#47;">here<&#47;a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>An exploration of the web as a medium. The web is becoming an increasingly mixed medium with the growing list of technologies we have at our disposal. In this session we will discuss rich web experiences and different techniques used to achieve them. We will also cover new and upcoming web features and explore how these may change the way we create rich web content in the future.<&#47;blockquote></p>
