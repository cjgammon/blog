  To download the latest version of pixi.js you can check the releases tab of the github repository <a href="https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js/releases">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Because of browser security restrictions loading local assets directly will result in CORS errors. We'll need to get around this in Pixi.js because you can't do much without loading textures. The easiest way to avoid this is to run your code on a server. You can run a local server if you have python installed by opening terminal navigating to your project directory and running <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code> which will run a local server at localhost with the port defined: <code>localhost:8000</code>. Now simply loading this page should run the index.html file at your project directory without any issues.
</p>
<p>
  The quickest way to get started with Pixi.js is with a helper class called <code>PIXI.Application</code>. This class combines and abstracts a bunch of common utilities used when making content with Pixi.js.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
const app = new PIXI.Application({
  view: canvas,
  width: window.innerWidth,
  height: window.innerHeight
});
</code></pre>
<p>It can take a number of parameters including width and height. You can also provide your own canvas element as the rendering surface as the view. If you do not provide a view, you can append the canvas created for you to the DOM using <code>document.body.appendChild(app.view)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Next we need to load a texture into webGL. `Pixi.Texture` has a `from()` method which takes the path to the image as a prameter. Calling this returns the instance of our texture.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
const texture = PIXI.Texture.from('sprite.png');
</code></pre>
<p>
  Now that we have our texture we can use it to create a sprite. `PIXI.Sprite()` takes a single parameter of a texture instance.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
const img = new PIXI.Sprite(texture);
</code></pre>
<p>
  Now that we have our sprite we can set properties of it, like the x and y position. We can also set the anchor position to the center. Since it is a webGL quad the anchor coordinates for the center are 0.5 on the x and y axis. After we have it set up the way we want we can add it to the stage. The stage is also created for us with `PIXI.Application` and can be referenced by `app.stage`. By calling `addChild()` we can add objects to the stage.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
img.x = app.screen.width / 2;
img.y = app.screen.height / 2;
img.anchor.x = 0.5;
img.anchor.y = 0.5;
app.stage.addChild(img);
</code></pre>
<p>
Now you should have an image at the center of the screen.
</p>
<p>
Now we need to add some animation. Again `PIXI.Application` helps us out here by creating a `ticker` for us, which is a render loop running utilizing `requestAnimationFrame`. We can access this through `app.ticker`. Then we simply call `add()`, passing in the method that we want it to call for each animation loop.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
app.ticker.add(animation);
</code></pre>
<p>
Then we can update properties of our scene inside the animation method.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">
function animation() {
  img.rotation += 0.1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
This should have your sprite rotating in a circle around the center axis.
