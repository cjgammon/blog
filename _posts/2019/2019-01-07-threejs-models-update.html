<p>
In my post on <a href="/threejs-models">Loading Models in Three.js</a> I was using version 79.  Three.js is now at version 100 and some changes have been made to how models are loaded.  In this video I describe how to export glTF models from Blender and import them into Three.js. You can read the documentation on loading models into three.js <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Loading-3D-models">here</a>.

<br/><br/>
<small>Note: these examples were created using Three.js v100. Three.js is known to update frequently and sometimes cause breaking changes to the API so it may be worth checking the version you are using.</small>
