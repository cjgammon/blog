Pixi.js is a 2D Graphics Rendering framework for the web.  It was created by Matt Groves to normalize the canvas and webgl APIs into a simple scene graph originally modeled loosely on the Flash API.  Its primary focus has always been on performance so that it is really fast.  Because of this it is primarily a webGL rendering surface with canvas 2d fallback.</p>
<p>
  To get Pixi.js and read more about it you can visit its website <a href="http://pixijs.com">pixijs.com</a>.  There they have download links examples and other resources for learning as well as a link to the github repository to keep up to date with its development.

  Check out the <a href="https://pixijs.io/bunny-mark/">Bunny Mark</a> performance test to get an idea of how fast Pixi is.
