<p>
  Recently I've been interested in libraries, particularly rendering libraries, like Snap.SVG, Pixi.js and the like.
  I've also been a big fan of Greensock's animation library, <a href="http://greensock.com/gsap">GSAP</a>.
  And while they still have TweenLite they also used to have a Nano library which was even more optimized for things like banner ads when file size is of importance.
  While file size is still important, with the speeds we have today I feel it's often not as prioritized as it used to be but there are still cases when it's the deciding factor on whether to use a library.
</p>
<p>
  So I started looking at my rendering libraries and they're often filled with a lot of extras that I don't often need.
  This made me wonder how light of a library I could get if it only focused on rendering and nothing else with a priority on light file size.
  So I started making them:
</p>

<b><a href="https://github.com/cjgammon/Hydrogen">Hydrogen</a></b>
<p>
  Hydrogen is a lightweight canvas rendering library and display list that is around 1k in file size.
</p>
<b><a href="https://github.com/cjgammon/Carbon">Carbon</a></b>
<p>
  Carbon is a lightweight SVG drawing library also around 1k.
</p>
<p>
  I just started playing around with this and haven't used them extensively yet, but I think it's a neat idea.
  Let me know what you think, are these valuable? What other kind of situation would you want a minimal library for?
</p>
