<p>There are certain things I find I do now and again which would be nice to automate.  One of them is revealing hidden files, on a mac that means the file name begins with a period, like a .htaccess file.  Typically I would go into terminal, write a little shell command and then I'd have a messy desktop and file browsing until I got around to hiding hidden files again.  So I wrote the below shell script which will do this switch for me.  I've even set it up as a trigger in Quicksilver so I can toggle it on and off with a keyboard shortcut.  Pretty simple!</p>
<pre>[code]<br />
on run<br />
	set hiddenState to (do shell script "&#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;defaults read com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles")</p>
<p>	try<br />
		tell application "Finder" to quit</p>
<p>		if (hiddenState is "ON") then<br />
			do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles OFF"<br />
			delay 3<br />
		else if (hiddenState is "OFF") then<br />
			do shell script "defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles ON"<br />
			delay 3<br />
		end if</p>
<p>	on error myError<br />
		display dialog "problem:" &amp; myError<br />
	end try</p>
<p>	FinderCheck()<br />
end run</p>
<p>on FinderCheck()<br />
	tell application "System Events"<br />
		if (name of every process) does not contain "Finder" then<br />
			tell application "Finder" to launch<br />
		end if<br />
	end tell<br />
end FinderCheck<br />
[&#47;code]<&#47;pre></p>
