<p>With the to use alpha transparency natively in web video (currently only in <a href="https:&#47;&#47;www.google.com&#47;intl&#47;en&#47;chrome&#47;browser&#47;canary.html">Chrome Canary<&#47;a> under flags) read more <a href="http:&#47;&#47;updates.html5rocks.com&#47;2013&#47;07&#47;Alpha-transparency-in-Chrome-video">here<&#47;a>. This opens up the web for lots of interesting compositing of interactive video elements. I was also interested in what it meant for using video within canvas. I think there is some great potential within canvas and live web based motion graphics. &nbsp;When thinking about this, I had remembered OK Go's music video for their song WTF, which involved some interesting alpha layering.</p>

<p>This seemed reminiscent of 2D canvas' natural drawing process. That means achieving this effect with alpha video is very easy. Typically you have to clearRect to prevent this, so merely drawing alpha video on canvas only draws the non-transparent pixels allowing the previous frames to remain. You can see this in supported browsers at the codepen below. I think this shows the interesting potential new video capabilities combined with canvas allow.</p>
