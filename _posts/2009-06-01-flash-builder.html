<p>Hopefully now all the confusion over Flash&#47;Flex will subside to some extent or perhaps just become more foggy.&nbsp; Adobe's rebranding of all things running on the flash player as the Flash Platform also consists of rebranding the traditional Flex Builder, Eclipsed development application as <a title="Flash Builder" href="http:&#47;&#47;labs.adobe.com&#47;technologies&#47;flashbuilder4&#47;">Flash Builder<&#47;a>. My typical flash development workflow involves coding in Flex Builder to deploy from flash. And when I tell people I'm a flash developer, among other things, they ask me, 'do you know flex?'. I'll say, like mxml and actionscript applications?, only to be met with blank stares. The lack of understanding of the terms even among flash&#47;flex developers is often humorous, but hopefully the new branding will allow people to realize it's just different tools and methods to building essentially the same thing.</p>
