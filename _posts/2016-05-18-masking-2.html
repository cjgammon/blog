  As far as CSS features go this is still relatively new. Because of this, support can be spotty.  So let’s check out caniuse.com.  Caniuse is a website created by a friend of mine Alexis Diveria, that shows you what features are supported on which browser versions.

  Today the only solid CSS implementation is in webkit, so we’re going to focus on this.
  We’re going to cover basic masks in CSS and how you can use them.  Then get into some more advanced CSS masking features and what they enable.
  Masking in the webkit implementation uses the webkit prefix for all it’s properties.

  CSS Masking is very similar to CSS backgrounds, it as a shorthand as well as independent properties that can be applied like repeat or sizing.
  The mask image property is a CSS image just like background images so it can be any type of image supported by CSS like a url image or a CSS gradient.

  Masking in webkit uses an inverted luminance mask so we can create this in photoshop.
  We can then apply this to any HTML content, like text in CSS.

  In the video above I also discuss clip paths as well as more advanced CSS masking techniques using mask-composite and multiple mask image layers.
