<p>So yesterday I thought it would be useful to have a tool that generates CSS classes based on defined slices of an image. &nbsp;There are tools out there that do this but I wanted to be able to custom tweak it to do what i wanted and output things a certain way. &nbsp;So I made one. &nbsp;It's very rough around the edges and definitely read the instructions before using as I made it in an afternoon, but check it out and feel free to add to it or change it to your liking.</p>
