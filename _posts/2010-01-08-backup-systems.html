<p>it seems sometimes it takes a bit of a catastrophe to remind us of the importance of a fail proof backup system.</p>
<ul>
<li>have an automated on-site backup system, using an external hard drive</li>
<li>if possible have a somewhat regular off-site backup (in case of fire or burglary)</li>
<li>if there are files you cannot live without ensure they are in multiple locations and possibly even online via a system like SVN</li><br />
</ul><br />
external hard drives are relatively cheap these days, so there's really no excuse to have all your data preserved in the case of an emergency. &nbsp;these tips are pretty basic, but if followed should allow you peace of mind when it comes to the potential of data loss via hard drive failure.</p>
