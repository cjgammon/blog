<p>So I've always been in love with safari's Activity window, but I often like using more common browsers for website debugging and hate jumping over to safari which typically runs the same as my standard browser firefox.&nbsp; Also when troubleshooting the inevitable IE problems it's nice to see what is being referenced and where things are breaking on a http level.&nbsp; <a title="Charles" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.charlesproxy.com&#47;" target="_blank">Charles<&#47;a> to the rescue!&nbsp; I recently discovered this debugging program that allows you to do this kind of tracking in all your browsers which really comes in handy if you really enjoy using the activity window like I do.</p>
