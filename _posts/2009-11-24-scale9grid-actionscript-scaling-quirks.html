<p>So the nifty scale9Grid scaling mode for movieclips which allows you to maintain rounded corners or fancy perimeters and whatnot for expandable elements like dialogue boxes or expanding menus has some lame little quirks.  You can not use it as a mask or it will revert to normal scaling mode, also you can not rotate the movie clip or it will revert to normal scaling mode again. I don't really know why they can't support these minor and often necessary uses with scale9Grid.  I'm sure they have a reason. </p>
